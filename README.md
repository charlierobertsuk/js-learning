# JavaScript Learning Repository

Welcome to my `js-learning` repository! This project showcases my journey through learning JavaScript, with all the skills and projects I've completed as part of the **Udemy course: "The Complete JavaScript Course"** by Jonas Schmedtmann. You can find the course here: [The Complete JavaScript Course](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-javascript-course/).

## About This Repository

This repository contains all the code, exercises, and mini-projects I've worked on while following Jonas Schmedtmann's comprehensive JavaScript course. It reflects my progress in mastering JavaScript concepts and applying them to practical examples.

### Skills Learned
Through this course, I've gained hands-on experience with the following JavaScript topics:
- **Fundamentals**: Variables, data types, operators, and control structures.
- **Functions**: Declarations, expressions, arrow functions, and higher-order functions.
- **Arrays & Objects**: Manipulation, methods, and iteration techniques.
- **DOM Manipulation**: Interacting with and dynamically updating web pages.
- **Events**: Handling user interactions like clicks, keypresses, and more.
- **Asynchronous JavaScript**: Promises, async/await, and API calls.
- **ES6+ Features**: Destructuring, spread/rest operators, modules, and more.
- **Project Building**: Applying all concepts to create functional applications.

Each folder or file in this repository corresponds to a specific section or project from the course, demonstrating how I've applied these skills.

## How to Use This Repository
1. **Explore the Code**: Browse the folders and files to see my implementations of various JavaScript concepts.
